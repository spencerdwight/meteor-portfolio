## Introduction

Yo this is a markdown post and also an attempt at pushing through a blog post onto the site.

## Main Content

Expanding on this I can format things with **bold**, *italics*, and `code snippets` as needed.

### Subheading Example

I can also adjust the content into lists and bullet points, I guess?

- Use bullet points for lists
- Or numbered lists:
  1. Step one
  2. Step two

## Conclusion

This was a good test, let's see if we are up and running!
